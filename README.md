# UE Mod Loader

A simple Mod Loader for Unreal Engine games that automatically loads every `.dll` file placed in the `mods` folder. As expected, this will only load mods that function under the logic of DLL injection.

_Note: This Mod Loader has been tested with **Grounded** and **Orcs Must Die! 3**. While it's expected to be compatible with other Unreal Engine games, compatibility may vary. If you encounter any issues, please [create an issue](https://github.com/your-repo/issues) on the repository._

## Installation

1. **Download the Mod Loader:**
   - You can download the Mod Loader from [Nexus Mods](#) or from the [Releases section](https://github.com/samjviana/UE-Mod-Loader/releases) on this repository.

2. **Extract the Mod Loader files:**
   - Extract the contents of the downloaded `.zip`.

3. **Move the Mod Loader extracted files:**
   - For **GamePass**, place the files in:
     ```
     <installation_directory>\Content\<game_identifier>\Binaries\WinGDK\
     ```
   - For **Other Launchers** (like Steam and Epic), place the files in:
     ```
     <installation_directory>\<game_identifier>\Binaries\Win64\
     ```
   - Ensure the Mod Loader's `dxgi.dll` file is placed in the same folder where the game's Unreal Engine executable (e.g., `<game_identifier>-Win64-Shipping.exe`) is located.

**Note:** 
- _`installation_directory` is the root folder where the game is installed. For example, `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Grounded`._
- _`game_identifier` refers to the specific game module, such as `Maine` for Grounded or `OMD` for Orcs Must Die! 3._

This will allow the Mod Loader to seamlessly load all `.dll` mods from the `mods` folder when the game starts.

               │    └─── <your_mod.dll>
               └─── <game_identifier>-Win64-Shipping.exe
```

## TODO

- Add a logging structure to the Mod Loader to ease future debugging.
- Implement configuration options fot the Mod Loader (e.g., a `.ini` file):
   - Customizable load order for specific mods
   - Blocklist for specific mods (If the user don't want to delete the mod)
- Explore the possibility of an interactive in-game overlay for mod management (GUI)
   - _This is an idea I may not end up pursuing._
